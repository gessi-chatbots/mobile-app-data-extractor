Other than that, does a good job finding routes. Let's you backup/restore config though, so it's not a recurring annoyance changing that.",

Many times there is no address available at all, you'll sometimes only get a list of cross streets along the road you need... you basically need to know where you're going, mark it on osmand then navigate to the mark.

I understand that's Google TTS but given that's the best option for this app, it stinks. Third, this makes my phone blazing hot.
